# Movie Emoji App

This android application is a demonstration of the capabilities of the OpenAI API. It takes in a movie title as input and returns an emoji representation of the movie.

## Getting Started

This project is built with Kotlin and makes use of the MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture concepts. The UI is designed with Jetpack Compose and the dependency injection framework used is Dagger/Hilt.

To run the project, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for a free API key on the OpenAI website. Once you have obtained the key, you can insert it in the `local.properties` file located in the root directory.

You can then build and run the project on an emulator or a physical android device.
